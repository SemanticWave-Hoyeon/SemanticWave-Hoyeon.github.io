## Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities in S-100-Based Maritime Navigation Software

Our latest research paper has been published in **Sensors** (SCIE), uncovering critical security vulnerabilities in the S-100 standard used for next-generation Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS).

## CVE-2026-22208

A Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier was assigned for the critical vulnerability discovered in this research:

- **CVE ID**: [CVE-2026-22208](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22208)
- **CVSS Score**: **9.3** (Critical)
- **Type**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Vector**: Malicious Portrayal Catalogue containing weaponized Lua scripts

---

## Key Findings

### The Vulnerability

The S-100 standard uses **Lua scripts** within Portrayal Catalogues to render electronic navigational charts. However, the standard **lacks security specifications** for script execution. We discovered that OpenS100, a reference implementation for next-generation ECDIS, runs an **unrestricted Lua interpreter** — granting full access to `os`, `io`, `debug`, `loadfile`, and `dofile` libraries.

This means a malicious Portrayal Catalogue can:
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Read/write files on the host system
- Establish persistent backdoors
- Exfiltrate sensitive navigation data

### SAST Tools vs. Expert Review

We evaluated four automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools against expert manual security review:

| Method | Vulnerabilities Found | Detection Rate |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| SAST Tools (combined) | 4 of 23 | 17% |
| Expert Manual Review | 23 of 23 | 100% |

Automated tools **failed to detect 83%** (19/23) of expert-identified vulnerabilities, including the critical RCE flaw. The primary reasons:

- **Limited maritime domain knowledge** — tools lack understanding of S-100 standard semantics
- **Cross-language blind spots** — unable to trace security risks across the C++–Lua interface
- **Specification-level flaws** — tools focus on code bugs, not design-level security gaps

### Root Cause: Specification Gap

The vulnerabilities stem from **gaps in the S-100 standard itself**, not isolated coding errors. The IHO S-100 Part 9a specifies the use of Lua for portrayal but does not mandate:

- Script sandboxing
- Library restrictions
- Input validation for catalogue files
- Integrity verification of Lua scripts

## RCE Demonstration

![RCE demonstration via OpenS100's unrestricted Lua interpreter](/assets/img/sensors-26-01246-g005.png)
_Proof-of-Concept: calc.exe and notepad.exe executed via malicious Portrayal Catalogue while normal nautical chart data loads successfully in OpenS100_

## Exploitation Lifecycle

```
Attacker crafts malicious Portrayal Catalogue
        ↓
Catalogue distributed via supply chain
(update server, USB, network share)
        ↓
ECDIS loads Portrayal Catalogue
        ↓
Unrestricted Lua interpreter executes malicious scripts
        ↓
Remote Code Execution achieved
(data exfiltration, persistent backdoor, system compromise)
```

## Recommendations

The paper proposes that the **International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)** incorporate the following security controls into the S-100 framework before the **2029 mandatory adoption deadline**:

1. **Script Sandboxing** — Restrict Lua execution to safe libraries only (`base`, `string`, `table`, `math`)
2. **Library Restrictions** — Disable `os`, `io`, `debug`, `loadfile`, `dofile`
3. **Catalogue Integrity Verification** — Cryptographic signatures for Portrayal Catalogues
4. **Restricted File System Access** — Limit searchable paths to the Portrayal Catalogue directory only

> These recommendations are already implemented in our [FerriteS100](/posts/ferrite-s100/) project as a reference for secure S-100 portrayal engine design.

## Significance

This is the **first published CVE** targeting the S-100 maritime navigation standard. The findings demonstrate that:

- Functional safety certifications alone are insufficient — security must be addressed at the design level
- Automated tools cannot replace expert security review for domain-specific maritime software
- The S-100 standard requires urgent security amendments before its mandatory adoption in 2029
