## SemanticWave Signs Project Agreement with POSSM

SemanticWave has signed a project agreement with **POSSM Co., Ltd.** for the development of a maritime data management and analysis system.

This project focuses on building a **full lifecycle framework** covering the end-to-end flow from **data collection to analysis**. The goal is to establish a practical and scalable data foundation that supports data-driven value creation in the maritime and energy industry.

Through this collaboration, SemanticWave will continue delivering implementation-focused data and AI capabilities designed for real operational environments.

We look forward to delivering meaningful results through this project.
