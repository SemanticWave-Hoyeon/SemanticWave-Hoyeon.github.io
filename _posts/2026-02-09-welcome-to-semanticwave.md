## Reimagining the Ocean through Data

**SemanticWave** is officially setting sail. 

Born at the intersection of deep-sea experience and advanced data science, we are a tech-driven startup dedicated to the **Digital Transformation** of the maritime industry. We don't just process data; we bridge the gap between raw maritime information and actionable intelligence.

### What Defines Us

Our strength lies in the synergy between **on-site maritime expertise** (Navigation & Operations) and **cutting-edge AI research**.

* **Deep Learning for Vessel Performance**
    : Developing high-precision models for fuel consumption prediction and carbon emission analysis. We transform sensor data into operational efficiency.
* **Semantic Intelligence & NLP**
    : Applying Natural Language Processing to maritime safety. From error recovery in NAVTEX messages to semantic classification of S-100 standard data, we ensure information is accurate and interoperable.
* **Next-Gen Standards (S-100)**
    : Researching and implementing the S-100 framework to lead the future of digital e-Navigation.
